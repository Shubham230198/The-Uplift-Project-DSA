## Week 1 (Completed)
  * [Basic Java for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34&feature=youtu.be)
     -Here, in this tutorial they have used Intelij -IDE for explaining Java, but in our project we won't use any type of IDE, we will be using simple text editor(like VS-Code). Don't worry about it, we mentors will explain you how to use VS-Code. Right now, all of you just learn the basics of how to code in java.

## Week 2 (Completed)
   The recusion is one of the very interesting topic in DSA, and very-difficult to undersand at it's the application level. So, practice more and more questions on this topic. ATTEND SESSIONS REGULARLY, as mentors will be explaining most of the topics, for better understanding of concepts.

## Week 5 (Completed)
  This week's topic is Time-Complexity Analysis, and this week doesn't contain any coding assignment. Just there are set of MCQ type questions on InterviewBit (last link), you have to complete this content till Tuesday (21 July).
  
  * [Time Complexity Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL72OBdV5phFn5DpigSScsBOBRYhdCxB6p) (Playlist about how to find time-complexity over the codes)

  * [InterviewBit Complexity Assesment](https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/topics/time-complexity/) (Complete the tutorial, and then go for MCQs.
  
  

## Week 6 (Completed)  
  This week's topics are Searching and Sorting. We will be learning 7 types of sorting and their time-complexity analysis, i.e Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort and Heap Sort. Do join the sessions, as we will be coding all the Sorting algos there along with explanation.


  All of these tutorials will explain you pseudo code and some might show actual code(written in cpp), but we have to consider only pseudo code and write our code in java using pseudo code. This will increase your ability to convert a given approach into code.
