## Week 1 (Completed)
  * [Basic Java for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34&feature=youtu.be)
     -Here, in this tutorial they have used Intelij -IDE for explaining Java, but in our project we won't use any type of IDE, we will be using simple text editor(like VS-Code). Don't worry about it, we mentors will explain you how to use VS-Code. Right now, all of you just learn the basics of how to code in java.

## Week 2 (Completed)
   The recusion is one of the very interesting topic in DSA, and very-difficult to undersand at it's the application level. So, practice more and more questions on this topic. ATTEND SESSIONS REGULARLY, as mentors will be explaining most of the topics, for better understanding of concepts.

## Week 5 (On Going)
  This week's topic is Time-Complexity Analysis, and this week doesn't contain any coding assignment. Just there are set of MCQ type questions on InterviewBit (last link), you have to complete this content till Tuesday (21 July).
  
  * [Time Complexity Analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL72OBdV5phFn5DpigSScsBOBRYhdCxB6p) (Playlist about how to find time-complexity over the codes)
