## Week 1 (Completed)
  * [Basic Java for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34&feature=youtu.be)
     -Here, in this tutorial they have used Intelij -IDE for explaining Java, but in our project we won't use any type of IDE, we will be using simple text editor(like VS-Code). Don't worry about it, we mentors will explain you how to use VS-Code. Right now, all of you just learn the basics of how to code in java.
